SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
The implementation follows a modular, component-based architecture utilizing TypeScript for type safety and React for declarative UI rendering. The system employs a client-server model with RESTful API endpoints for data exchange.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
â€¢ Framework: React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x
â€¢ State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
â€¢ Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes
â€¢ Build Tool: Vite 5.x for optimized bundling
â€¢ Deployment: Static hosting via GitHub Pages

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Initial Load Time: < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3s
- Bundle Size: Optimized chunks < 500KB
- Lighthouse Score: 95+ (Performance, Accessibility, SEO)

ERROR HANDLING:
Implements try-catch blocks with fallback mechanisms and user-friendly error messages. All async operations include timeout handling and retry logic.`,
